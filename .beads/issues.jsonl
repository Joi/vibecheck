Specific refinements needed:\n\nFix in Discover:\n1. Card entrance uses spring curve (overshoot) - wrong for entrance, use decelerate: cubic-bezier(0,0,0.2,1)\n2. Harden entrance rAF timing - use forced reflow (card.offsetHeight) instead of fragile double-rAF\n3. Remove !important from exit transforms - clear inline styles in completeSwipe() instead\n4. Fix renderCards() timing: delay = speed * 1000 (not speed * 1000 - 50) to prevent flash\n\nAdd across site:\n5. Replace transition: all with explicit property lists (performance)\n6. Add standard easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) instead of default ease\n7. Score counter scale pulse on increment\n8. Empty state fade-up entrance animation\n9.
